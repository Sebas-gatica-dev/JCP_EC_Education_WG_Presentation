# JCP_EC_Education_WG_Presentation
This is the sample code for use with the JCP EC Education WG slide presentation.

JShellDemoCode.txt contains a block of code that can be pasted into JShell thru the command /edit or loaded with the command /open command.

The JavaCalculator01, 02, & 03 are executable Java code that can be run using the Single-File Source-Code command line execution. The command line to enter is a comment at the end of each file.

The PythonCalculator01, 02, & 03 are equivalent programs to the Java examples that can be run on the command line.

The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate that the perceived brevity of Python and that the simplicity of executing Python code is a myth.
